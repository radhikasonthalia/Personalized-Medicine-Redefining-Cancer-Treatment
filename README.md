# Personalized-Medicine-Redefining-Cancer-Treatment
#### A lot has been said during the past several years about how precision medicine and, more concretely, how genetic testing is going to disrupt the way diseases like cancer are treated.Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). 

#### For this Kaggle competition MSKCC is making available an expert-annotated knowledge base where world-class researchers and oncologists have manually annotated thousands of mutations.

#### I have developed a Machine Learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.

#### Techniques used:
1. Used algorithms to classify genetic mutations in cancerous tumours based on clinical evidence ( text.) 
1. Differentiate the  mutations that contribute to tumour growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). 
1. Natural Language Processing techniques using nltk
1. TF-IDF and bag of words used to extract features from text files 
1. Classic Machine Learning models along with k-fold cross-validation and dimensionality reduction to make predictions
